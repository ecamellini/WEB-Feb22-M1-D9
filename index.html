    REQUIREMENTS GATHERING / ANALYSIS / DISCOVERY PHASE
    (Analysts / Business Analysts / UX Designers)
    All the stakeholders involved in the project must be included in this phase.

    Let's think just the first features we need to make it functional.
    MVP: Minimum Viable Product.
    Then we will build the rest of the features in future releases, based on users feedback.

    FEATURES & WHY:
    - Visualize the days of the current month, because I need to be able to select a day
    - Select a day, because I want to setup a meeting on that day (I can change day and select another one whenever I want)
    - Adding an event to the selected day, after selecting time & name, so that I can remember it
    - Visualize the appointments/meetings for the selected day (the ones I already added)


        Usually we can write these in the form of user stories, for example:
        - As a user of the calendar, I need to be able to select a day, because I want to setup a meeting on that day

    ASSUMPTION:
    - To start with, let's just build a simple calendar for events only (no reminders, no other things)
    - At the momenth, let's just assume that we always have 31 days
        (I don't want to deal with real dates/months at the moment - it's complex in JS)
    - Let's not handle errors at the moment: not a problem if we add two events with the same time & name

    NICE TO HAVE (FOR FUTURE RELEASES):
    - Having also reminders implemented
    - Exporting/importing events
    - etc....

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    SOFTWARE DESIGN PHASE:
    ( Software architects / software developers )

    Design the way in which we are going to build the software: main components,
    functions/modules etc. etc.

    In this case, we're gonna talk about:

    MAIN HTML ELEMENTS:
    - title for the calendar (h1)
    - divs for the days, and a div for the month (a container)
    - div for the area where to input event details & save an event
    - h1 / h3 to title this section & the inputs
    - input tags to input event details (time input, text input for time & name) & a button to save
    - appointments for the day section: title & a list of events (<ul> or similar)

    MAIN STYLES/CLASSES:
    - main style for the body: dark background, font family, font color, align ceter, etc.
    - days: a highlight when selected (border, etc.)
    - month: a border etc. to make visible the fact that it is surrounding the days
    - title: same color (green for example), uppercase, bold
    - inputs & button: same color as the titles, etc.
    - event in the list of events

    MAIN JS FUNCTIONS:
    Usually we say: event -> what happens

    - when clicking on save -> take input values & add a new event to the current day
    - when clicking on a day
        -> show that the day is selected/highlighted & also un-highlight the previous one
        -> show the events already saved for that day (hide/don't show the ones for the previously selected day)
